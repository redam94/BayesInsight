    Parameters
    ----------
    x :
        The array to convolve.
    w :
        The weight of the convolution. The last axis of ``w`` determines the number of steps
        to use in the convolution.
    axis : int
        The axis of ``x`` along witch to apply the convolution
    mode : ConvMode, optional
        The convolution mode determines how the convolution is applied at the boundaries
        of the input signal, denoted as "x." The default mode is ConvMode.Before.

        - ConvMode.After: Applies the convolution with the "Adstock" effect, resulting in a trailing decay effect.
        - ConvMode.Before: Applies the convolution with the "Excitement" effect, creating a leading effect
            similar to the wow factor.
        - ConvMode.Overlap: Applies the convolution with both "Pull-Forward" and "Pull-Backward" effects,
            where the effect overlaps with both preceding and succeeding elements.

    Returns
    -------
    y :
        The result of convolving ``x`` with ``w`` along the desired axis. The shape of the
        result will match the shape of ``x`` up to broadcasting with ``w``. The convolved
        axis will show the results of left padding zeros to ``x`` while applying the
        convolutions.
